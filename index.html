    <h2>Hi <span class="auto-type"></span> </h2>
    <p>
        I'm Chloe, a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, currently pursuing my M.S. in Computational 
        Science and Engineering. <br><br>

        My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning, data analysis, and computational innovation, 
        where I continually try to expand my knowledge and skills. During my previous internships, I sharpened 
        my expertise in predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and data visualization and can transform complex data 
        into meaningful insights. <br><br>
        
        But there's more to me than just data and algorithms. I'm a French citizen and spent my entire childhood in Qatar, which 
        has given me a unique perspective of the world. This diverse upbringing enabled me to become fluent in four languages 
        and enhanced my ability to connect with diverse groups of people. It has also shaped my approach to problem-solving, 
        allowing me to bring creative and inclusive solutions to the table. <br><br>
        
        This website is a window into my journey. Here, you'll find detailed descriptions of some fun projects I worked on and 
        my contact information in case you want to know more. <br><br>
